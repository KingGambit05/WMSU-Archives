People nowadays can choose assorted types of entertainment through different forms of media. Comic books and graphic novels fall short in terms of educational value compared to reference materials in school libraries. This study, therefore, seeks to develop an encompassing collection development policy that aims to include comic books and graphic novels in the library collection in consonance with the preference of young adults in Malabón City which are St. Therese of the Child Jesus Academy, Philippine Malabon Institute, and St. James Academy.

The research instruments involved in this study are a survey questionnaire to know the information needs of the students regarding comics and structured interviews to determine the perceptions of the head librarians on the acquisition of comics in their libraries. A total of 161 students were given the survey questionnaires throughout the three schools. The librarians answered structured interviews from each institution.

The data gathered from the survey questionnaire and the structured interviews revealed that: (a) 21.6% of the respondents show that comedy/humor s the preferred genre by the students, (b) 31.6% of the respondents prefer comic books as their format, (c) 42.8% of the responses show that leisure is the primary purpose why students read comics, (d) 96.9% of the students that were surveyed agree to the inclusion of comic books and graphic novels in their libraries, (e) The head librarian of faculty in charge is not familiar with Eisner's Standards for comics in school libraries, (f) School libraries invest more in acquiring reference materials compared to comic books and graphic novels, (g) their holdings vary independently.

This research could convince school administrations that comic books and graphic novels are as essential as other resource materials within their library. It would also prepare the library staff to introduce these materials as educational tools to the institution's educators and students.
