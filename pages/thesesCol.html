              This paper evaluates the influence of a nineteenth-century French
              manual on the restoration of prints, drawings, and books to
              contemporary conservation philosophy and practice. First published
              in 1846, Essai sur la restauration des anciennes estampes et des
              livres rares was researched and written by Alfred Bonnardot
              (1808-1884) a writer, bibliophile, and historian of Paris. His
              manual, offering fellow amateurs of prints and books a nuanced
              range of clearly-described restoration procedures, found a growing
              audience that encouraged the issue of an enlarged second edition
              in 1858. At 349 pages, this second edition of the Essai remains
              the most comprehensive and detailed text on paper restoration of
              the nineteenth century in a western European language. The manual
              was translated into a German edition in 1859, and has since been
              reissued in French facsimile editions in 1967 and 1979. It is now
              available to anyone through Google Books on the Web. A published
              translation of the full text in English has not yet appeared.
