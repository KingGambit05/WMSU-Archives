          <h2 class="PolicySubheading">1.1. Background</h2>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            The WMSU Research Archive (WRA) is being launched to centralize the
            university's scholarly works—theses, dissertations, journal
            articles, reports, and other research outputs—into a single,
            open‐access platform. It follows the model of Harvard's DASH, which
            since 2009 has served as Harvard's central open‐access repository
            for community scholarship.
          </p>

          <h2 class="PolicySubheading">1.2. Administration</h2>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            Day‐to‐day management of WRA shall be the responsibility of the WMSU
            Library, under the Office of Research and Development. High‐level
            policies and strategic decisions will be overseen by the Office of
            the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (OVCAA), similar to the
            governance structure of DASH at Harvard.
          </p>

          <h1 class="PolicyHeading">Mission Statement</h1>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            The WMSU Research Archive is the official institutional repository
            of Western Mindanao State University. It identifies, acquires,
            preserves, and provides open, long‐term access to the university's
            digital research outputs, supporting WMSU's core missions of
            education, research, and community engagement.
          </p>

          <h1 class="PolicyHeading">Authority</h1>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            This initiative is launched by WMSU's Office of Research and
            Development in collaboration with the University Library. It derives
            its mandate from the university's charter and the Library's archival
            responsibilities, analogous to ESCAP's use of DSpace for
            policy‐driven repositories.
          </p>

          <h1 class="PolicyHeading">Collection Development Statement</h1>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            Materials in WRA shall reflect the university's academic scope and
            have enduring administrative, legal, fiscal, research, or historical
            value. Collection criteria follow best practices outlined by peer
            institutions, such as the University of Hawai'i's ScholarSpace
            collection development guidelines.
          </p>

          <p class="PolicyText">WRA will host digital versions of:</p>

              Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) from all

          <h1 class="PolicyHeading">Executive Summary</h1>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            The WMSU Research Archive ETD Policy establishes a framework to
            maximize access to student research, protect author and university
            rights, and ensure long‑term preservation of digital theses and
            dissertations. Rooted in the Philippine Technology Transfer Act (RA
            10055) and WMSU's Intellectual Property policy, it assigns clear
            responsibilities to contributors, library staff, and administrators,
            and defines submission, access, and take‑down procedures.
          </p>

          <h1 class="PolicyHeading">1. Overview</h1>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) transform traditional,
            paper‑bound theses into digital formats that can be accessed and
            preserved online — making graduate student research available as
            full‑text documents and multimedia presentations for use by the
            university community and external scholars.
          </p>
          <p class="PolicyText">
            In line with Republic Act No. 10055 and WMSU's Revised Intellectual
            Property Policy, the ETD Program of WMSU pursues the following

            </li>
            <li class="PolicyListItem">
              Create a Comprehensive Library of WMSU's academic output in one
              searchable digital collection.

            <li class="PolicyListItem">
