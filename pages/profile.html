                    This paper evaluates the influence of a nineteenth-century
                    French manual on the restoration of prints, drawings, and
                    books to contemporary conservation philosophy and practice.
                    First published in 1846, Essai sur la restauration des
                    anciennes estampes et des livres rares was researched and
                    written by Alfred Bonnardot (1808-1884) a writer,
                    bibliophile, and historian of Paris. His manual, offering
                    fellow amateurs of prints and books a nuanced range of
                    clearly-described restoration procedures, found a growing
                    audience that encouraged the issue of an enlarged second
                    edition in 1858. At 349 pages, this second edition of the
                    Essai remains the most comprehensive and detailed text on
                    paper restoration of the nineteenth century in a western
                    European language. The manual was translated into a German
                    edition in 1859, and has since been reissued in French
                    facsimile editions in 1967 and 1979. It is now available to
                    anyone through Google Books on the Web. A published
                    translation of the full text in English has not yet
                    appeared.
